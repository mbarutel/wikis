By Michel Philippe Edubas
Graduate Fullstack Developer at SteelX 18.03.2024 - Current
Date of report 27.03.2025

# Introduction

- Talk about your role and responsibilities at SteelX
- Talk a little bit about SteelX and what they do
- Talk about SMS and how it helps the business
- Talk about the stack and technologies used

# Company Overview

- Talk more about Shed and how important they are in Australia
- Talk about the value or a well engineered Shed in Australia, as the area is prone to harsh weather at times
- Give some insight on the engineering required and how this has to be translated into code?
- Talk more about the tech stack and perhaps mention how it is ageing and the plan to upgrade this, maybe?

# Work Experience

- Talk about how you learnt to navigate through a huge code base
- The importance of strategic code changes that is digestable for the code reviewer
- The value of code review and QA (As non of that is happening in the company and that the time in Hive really made me appreciate that)
- The value of clean admin processes for department visibility to stake holders
- The value of slow and clear planning to help propel development and the fact that non of that is happening here

# My Contributions and Implementations

- Contributed a workflow on craeting release notes with the use of AI, shaving the time it takes from 1.5 days to 3-4 hours
- Bug fixing
- UI/UX improvements
- Improving processes
- Improving shed component calcutations process

# Conclusion

- Talk about how different the work environment actually is compared to Hive environment and how I've grown to appreciate more of the education given to us by hive.
- It helped me understand the fundamental importance of clean and slow process from development, code reviewing until testing.
- Moving slow is ulitimately the best way to move fast.
- Take time to understand the codebase so that you can be fast with getting the holistic view of the system and it's different components.

# Introduction

I started my role as a Graduate Software Developer at SteelX in March 2024. In my current role, I have an array of responsibilities, starting from programming features, fixing bugs, testing, code reviewing and so on. When we started, we took the time to learn about the system and how the users interact with it. This really gave me the understanding that the way the programmer views the system and how the users view it can be vastly different. It was definitely beneficial to take that time to see their point of view.

The company I work for is involved in selling Shed Buildings. With the help of their system- SMS, they have developed a workflow that streamlines the process of designing, generating plans, calculating engineering, and ordering parts for buying sheds.

SMS is running on dotnet, react and mysql and since any of my task is in either the frontd, backend, or database, my responsibilities is of that of a full stack developer.

# Company Overview

The company I work for, SteelX, is in the Shed Building Industry. They act as the middleman between the buyer and the steel supplier. Being the middleman generally does not have a nice conotation to it, but in this case, it is necessary. SteelX provides assistance in design, ordering of the components, and most importantly, the engineering. Without these services that the company provides, buying a shed building would be a slow and even more expensive process.

The system that we work on is called SMS- Sheds Management System or Sell More Shed, depending on who you ask. SMS is where sheds are designed, quotes created, documents generated and engineering calculated which in turn dictates the components to be used. The engineering is in essence the heart of SMS, without this automated calculations in place, the business would require and exponentially more engineers to do the calculations that SMS does on a daily basis. In summary, rather than 10 engineers churning out calculations for 20 sheds a day, 1 engineer can approve SMS' calculations for 50 sheds a day.

The technology used on SMS is dotnet with C# for the backend and React for the front end. From my experience, C# allows for fast development with its vast ecosystem of helper functions. The OOP nature of it allowed me to follow the large codebase easily, in my opinion. Plus, my overall development experience of it has been positive. On the front end side of things, React has been fine, it got the job done. SMS has evolved overtime, but some times, the evolution is slower than what developers would like. Despite my overall developer experience being positive, the system is running on a dotnet framework and is missing lots of modern functionalities that would have improved not just our experience, but the user as well. Perhaps, this was a good lesson that most companies will put off upgrading their stack infrastructure, as it may not provide any short term gains.

The company follows a water fall style of workflow due to the uncertain nature of the industry. When business is wanting to implement a new feature or update an old logic, it is most common that not all the necessary information is available. The buiseness is also lacking a proper Business analyist, thus most of the time, the tickets that are being mad is incomplete or vague. It makes the work of a developer more challenging, however, I have found that my education in Hive have tought me a great lesson in being resourceful and going out there to get the missing information for myself.
